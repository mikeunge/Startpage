# Idea for `Startpage`

## What should Startpage do?

Startpage should be like momentum in some sense. I invision it to be a, well, a Startpage... BUT more flexible and customizeable.
First things first, I'm unsure if it should have an api OR a nextjs backend. What's clear is that it should run reactjs for the frontend, because reasons.


## Roadmap

### General

The startpage should entirely be written in typescript.
For the configuration and stuff we run prism and a simple postgresql db server.


### API

As mentioned above, not entirely sure if we should run an API or serve everything from nextjs.


### Frontend

The frontend is clear, we want react.
Will probably run react with a styling framework (tailwind?) and maby a component framework like mui (?).
